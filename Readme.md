# Tetris for Desktop - tetris-desktop

An implementation of Tetris meant to be run on the desktop (and not a browser!)



### How to run

From VSCode, make sure you install the .NET MAUI extension, as well as the DevBox extension. When opening up the folder, go to the Command+Shift+P "Devbox: Reopen in Devbox shell environment" command and run that before doing anything else.

XCode needs to be installed and I had to go through [this fix](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dotnettools/issues/1148) to get things working.
